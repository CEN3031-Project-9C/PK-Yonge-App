<!--
THIS VIEW IS INTENTED TO SHOW LINKS TO ALL THE PREVIOUSLY TAKEN PRACTICE SESSIONS BY THE USER
CURRENTLY IT SHOWS INFORMATION FROM THE MOST RECENTLY COMPLETED TESTING SESSION.

IDEALLY, IT WOULD JUST SHOW ALL PREVIOUSLY-TAKEN TESTS, AND THEN A USER WOULD CLICK ON WHICH ONE THEY WANT TO SEE. 
THEN THEY WOULD BE TAKEN TO review-specific-test.client.view.html and would see this grading information on THAT page.
